## Bug list:

## To do:
- [ ] Better art for:

- [x] Health (see figure out food)
- [ ] Temples (do once chests figured out)
- [ ] Ingame Documentation - Decide how to do manual - Book item? Can we make it automatic?
- [ ] How to play (Ingame) - Text based or image? Control manipulation? 
- [ ] Achievements?
- [ ] Storyline - Someone stole Smae, your pet radish. 
- [ ] Boss battles - Platformer-style. See [Temple](https://theostestrpg.surge.sh/temple.html), but obviously much better. 
- [x] Hostile mobs
- [x] Massive inventory overhaul, including multiple stacks, stack limits, throw items, trash, stack splitting, and several bugs that popped up along the way. 

## To do in a long time:
- [ ] Other worlds:
  - Art
  - More powerful weapons, tools and mobs
  - Natural structures
  - Endgame - Story?
- [ ] Deploy app - Electron? :electron:
- [ ] Some sort of save feature - see Electron and figure something out.
- [ ] Ranged weapons - straight.

## To do once the entire game is done:
