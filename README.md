# SMAEBETA

## Bug list:
- [x] ~~Fix bug where space crashes if within one block of edge, by x. Because it can't break the void~~ 
- [x] ~~Fix ore spawn bug - ore can spawn in void or non-mountain. Something like this~~
- [ ] Fix knockback - Should repeatedly move a little bit when hit so doesn't teleport, total distance 1 block. 

## To do:
- [ ] Better art for:
  * Gel / torch items
  * Block cracking
- [ ] Figure out food
  * Whether to use
  * If used, how to eat, starvation rate, how to get.
  * If not used, how to regain health.
- [ ] Art for health/food (see prev)
- [ ] Chests
- [ ] Health (see figure out food)
- [ ] Temples (do once chests figured out)
- [ ] Ingame Documentation - Decide how to do manual - Book item? Can we make it automatic?
- [ ] How to play (Ingame) - Text based or image? Control manipulation? 
- [ ] Achievements?
- [ ] Storyline - Someone stole Smae, your pet radish. 
- [ ] Boss battles - Platformer-style. See [Temple](https://theostestrpg.surge.sh/temple.html), but obviously much better. 

## To do in a long time:
- [ ] Other worlds:
  - Art
  - More powerful weapons, tools and mobs
  - Natural structures
  - Endgame - Story?
- [ ] Deploy app - Electron? :electron:
- [ ] Some sort of save feature - see Electron and figure something out.
- [ ] Ranged weapons - straight. 

## To do once the entire game is done:
- [ ] Make your own canvas scroller app
