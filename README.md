- [x] Temples (do once chests figured out)
- [ ] Ingame Documentation - Decide how to do manual - Book item? Can we make it automatic?
- [ ] How to play (Ingame) - Text based or image? Control manipulation? 
- [ ] Achievements?
- [ ] Storyline - Someone stole Smae, your pet radish. 
- [ ] Boss battles - Platformer-style. See [Temple](https://theostestrpg.surge.sh/temple.html), but obviously much better. 
- [x] Hostile mobs
- [x] Massive inventory overhaul, including multiple stacks, stack limits, throw items, trash, stack splitting, and several bugs that popped up along the way. 
- [x] Data on hover / possible recipes / pagination for crafting(Useless because we only have a few recipes, but works) / Recipe on hover (shift).
